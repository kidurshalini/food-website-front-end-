    <h1>Human nothing without food</h1>
<p>
    Any material taken as food gives an organism energy and nutrient support. 
    Animals ingest it for development, health, or enjoyment and it can be ingested in raw, 
    processed, or prepared form. Proteins, carbs, fats, and water make up the majority of what we eat. 
    Food also contains organic compounds like vitamins and minerals like salts. Photosynthesis is 
    a process used by plants, algae, and some microbes to create their own food molecules. 
    Water has been acknowledged as a food in itself and is a component of many meals. The 
    components with the lowest energy densities, or calories, are water and fiber, whereas
    fat has the highest energy density. Additionally, some inorganic (non-food) components 
    are necessary for plant and animal life to operate.Human food can be categorized in a 
    number of ways, depending on its processing or substance. <br> <br>The quantity and make-up of 
    dietary categories can change. Most systems fall into one of four categories, each of 
    which describes their place of origin and relevant nutritional role: Fruit and vegetables, 
    bread and cereal, dairy products and meats. In studies on diet quality, foods are frequently 
    divided into categories such as whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, 
    nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened drinks. 
    Nineteen food classifications are used by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World 
    Health Organization: cereals, roots, pulses and nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, insects, 
    vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, spices and condiments, beverages, foods for
    nutritional uses, food for human consumption.
